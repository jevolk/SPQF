           The Senate and The People of Freenode ( #SPQF )


SPQF is a robust democratic channel management system with the goal of 
replacing the need for channel operators to be present, or even exist. 
The primary design parameter is the resistance to sybil from botnets and 
spam, in addition to various other noise and abuse seen regularly on IRC.
A versatile configuration can be customized on a per-channel basis to 
ensure any action by the bot reflects the true and fair intent of the 
channel's participants and community.

Join irc.freenode.net/#SPQF for feedback, suggestions and help.
We are open to all feature requests, especially reports of how attempts
are made to abuse the bot or conduct takeovers.
