"audibles":
"
A list of certain configuration values which may be passed as arguments when a vote starts. The values are applied to that vote only.
The list must be keys within config.vote and the speaker (creator of the vote) can set any of them using --key=value syntax at vote time, but cannot set others.
Example: 'config.vote.audibles = duration for' allows a vote to be started like '!vote ban --duration=5m --for=10h nickname'
",

"duration":
"
The amount of time a voting motion is open, accepting ballots.
This value is a duration of time: an integer either in seconds or with a postfix. See: !help time.
",

"enable":
"
This boolean value toggles whether a vote type is enabled, or at the config.vote level whether all vote types are enabled.
For example, to enable the ban vote type: config.vote.ban.enable = 1. This value defaults to false.
",

"for":
"
The amount of time the effects of a vote last if the motion passes. After this time an expiration event occurs. For example, if config.vote.quiet.for = 1h then when a user is quieted by a vote, they are unquieted after one hour.
This variable is succinctly named so that it can be typed as an option at vote time, ex: !vote quiet --for=1h nickname. See !help config.vote.audibles for vote-time options.
This value is a duration of time: an integer either in seconds or with a postfix. See: !help time.
"

		}
	},

"time":
"
The value is always a positive integer and may be followed by a unit postfix. A simple integer value represents seconds.
Units available: s = seconds, m = minutes, h = hours, d = days, w = weeks, M = months, y = years. Example: 10m is ten minutes, 2y is two years.
